### Simulation-Free Flow/Transport/Diffusion Generative Models from First Principles — with Historical Context

A first-principles introduction to transport, diffusion, and flow-based generative models—covering foundational ideas rarely found elsewhere (unless you propmt an LLM correctly).

It also aims to present the historical development of these concepts, though I am trying my best and make no guarantee of covering all relevant references.

The notes consist of the following sections 

```
    \core 
    \oracle
    \force 
    \manifold
    \monge
    \reversibility
```

In addition to the usual references on diffusion models and normalizing flows, I believe the following papers are especially noteworthy and influential:
